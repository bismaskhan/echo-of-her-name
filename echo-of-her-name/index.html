  <h2>About the Book</h2>
  <p>
    <em>The Echo of Her Name</em> is a quiet, haunting story about memory, silence, and the truths we avoid.
    As the past begins to surface, one name continues to echo — through letters, through absence, through lives
    that were never meant to collide.

  <h2>About the Author</h2>
  <p>
    I’m Bisma Saleem, a student and writer who believes stories are meant to be felt before they’re understood.
    <em>The Echo of Her Name</em> began as a quiet idea and grew into something I couldn’t ignore.
